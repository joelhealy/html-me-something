      <h2>What are Goodeids?</h2>
      <p>Goodeids are a family of fish (Goodeidae) consisting of approximately 40 species.  The vast majority of goodeids
         are members of a sub-family named Goodeinae.  These fish are livebearers and are endemic to Central Mexico.  There
         are a few species in a second sub-family named Empetrichthynae that are egg-layers and are endemic to the Southwest
         United States.  The current theory assumes that these fish all descended from a common ancestor and that the two
         sub-families were isolated by volcanic and seismic activity over a million years ago and developed separately.
      </p>
      <p> 
        I started keeping fish relatively late in life.  My sons received a 10 gallon fish tank for a Christmas present
        around the year 2000.  We went to a local pet store and bought a couple black mollies and a goldfish.  My sons
        quickly lost interest, but when the black mollies had babies I became interested in livebearing fish and have
        been keeping them ever since.  I started looking at AquaBid, a fishy version of eBay.  In 2001, I bought my first
        livebearing Goodied and I have had a special affinity for these Mexican fish to the present day.
      </p>
      <p>
        Because the egg-laying species of Goodieds from the United States are all protected and illegal to possess, I have
        concentrated on the livebearing Goodeids from Mexico.  I have kept around 30 of the 35 or so species at one time 
        or another.  In October of 2011, I flew to France to attend an international symposium on Goodeids.  At my peak, 
        I had close to 100 tanks in my basement, but I am currently down to a meager 25 or so.
        I have never really figured out why I am so interested in these ugly grey fish.  It saddens me that so many of
        the Goodeids have either become extinct in the wild or are well on their way.  I wish there was something I could
        do to protect their habitat for posterity, but I don't think there is.

      <p>
        <span class="genus">Allodontichthys</span> are one of the torpedo-shaped Goodeids.  There are two species of <span class="genus">Allodontichthys</span> that I have never kept, 
        <span class="species">Allodontichthys polylepis</span> and <span class="species">Allodontichthys zonistius</span>.  The <span class="species">A. polylepis</span> are believed to be extinct in the wild.  I 
        maintained <span class="species">A. tamazulae</span> only briefly and never got them to breed for me.  The <span class="species">A. hubbsi</span> (named after famous ichthyologist
        Carl Hubbs) was more prolific and easy to keep.

      <p>
        <span class="species">Alloophorus robustus</span> (a.k.a The Bulldog Goodeied) is one of the largest goodeids.  It has been known 
        to obtain a maximum length of 14 cm.  I have only kept this fish once and had no luck breeding my single pair of fish.  I bought
        my stock from a breeder in England.

      <h3><span class="genus">Allotoca</span></h3>
      <p>
        <span class="genus">Allotoca</span> is one of my favorite genera of Goodeids.
        As a matter of fact, at one time I bought the domain name allotocas.us and tried
        to build a static website devoted to these fish.  There are only two species of 
        <span class="genus">Allotca</span> that I have not kept, <span class="species">Allotoca diazi</span> 
        and <span class="species">Allotoca regalis</span>. In fact, I have never even seen
        <span class="species">A. regalis</span>.
      </p>
      <p>
        I have had the most luck with <span class="species">A. goslinei</span> and
        <span class="species">A. zacapuensis</span>.  I kept these fish for many, many
        years and was able to distribute hundreds of these fish to interested people
        at American Livebearers Association (ALA) conventions over the years.
        <span class="species">A. goslinei</span> have been extinct in the wild for
        many years and are only maintained in captivity by a handful of hobbyists.

      <p>
        <span class="species">Ameca splendens</span>, the Butterfly Goodeid, are very hardy fish
        and are easy to maintain in an aquarium.  They consume more vegetable content than most
        of the other Goodieds and are known to eat the algae off the sides of their tanks.  They
        were thought to be extinct in the wild at one point, but due to reintroduction efforts
        are once again found living in the central plateau of Mexico.

      <h3><span class="genus">Ataeniobius</span></h3>
      <p>
        <span class="genus">Ataeniobius toweri</span> are another of the torpedo-shaped Goodeids.
        Their claim to fame is that they are the only Goodeid which does not appear to have
        trophotaenia, placental-like structures through which females provide nutrition to the fry
        while they are insider her body.  The genus is actually named after this feature of the
        fish, however more recent studies of the species have reported finding trophotaenia on
        these fish.

      <h3><span class="genus">Chapalichthys</span></h3>
      <p>
        <span class="genus">Chapalicthys</span> are a deep-bodied goodeid.  Not many hobbyists
        show a lot of interest in these fish.  Outside of a yellow band on the caudal, they
        are the epitome of ugly grey fish (not to be confused with ugly tan fish or ugly
        brown fish).  Some people think there is a third species called <span class="species">
        Chapalicthys peraticus</span>, but it is not considered separate in most of the
        literature.

      <a id="characodon"/>
      <h3><span class="genus">Characodon</span></h3>
      <p>
        <span class="genus">Characodon</span> is the genus of goodeids that typical hobbyists
        are most interested in.  I believe this is based entirely on their appearance.  They
        are definitely the most colorful of the goodeids.  While many of the species designations
        among the goodeids seem to be based on accidents of history, none is more questionable
        than <span class="genus">Characodon</span>.  For example, one of the three species in
        the genus, <span class="species">Characodon garmani</span>, is based on a single
        preserved specimen of questionable origin.  This species hasn't been seen in nature
        for a hundred years.
      </p>
      <p>
        Many populations of <span class="genus">Characodon</span> have gone extinct before
        they could be assigned to one of the other two species.  Studies have been conducted
        recently by different researchers but no consensus has formed yet.  One of the definitive
        descriptions of the genus was written by a Mexican civil engineer named Juan Miguel
        Artigas Azas.

      <p>
        This genus of goodeids is relatively rare and difficult to maintain in captivity.
        They require clean cool water to survive which is little counter-intuitive as
        one of the only remaining locations where some of the fish can be found is a
        filthy city park in Mexico City with horrendous water quality due to massive
        pollution.

        very hardy fish and can be found in large schools in some Mexican lakes.
        They are one of the few fish that are actually consumed as food in many
        small villages.  They are one of the least endangered of all the goodeids.

        goodieds that are very common and in no immediate need of protection.
        One species has the common name of Basslet Goodeid.  This same species
        is very hardy and easy to maintain in aquaria.  In fact, they are so
        used to poor water quality that some hobbyists make a mistake by
        changing their water too often.

        in the wild.  There are huge disagreements as to how to assign recently
        discovered populations to the existing species.  Taxonomists vehemently
        argue about how to classify these fish.  It is very similar to the situation
        with <span class="genus">Characodon</span>.  There are "splitters" and "lumpers"

        <span class="genus">Characodon</span>, many populations disappeared
        before they could be properly studied and classified.  Juan Miguel
        Artigas Azas wrote a disheartening article about a distinct
